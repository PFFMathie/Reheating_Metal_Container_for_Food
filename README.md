# Reheating_Metal_Container_for_Food
This is an arduino project that I have created for a school project that is dedicated to technological innovations or such and such. 
This product called the RMC is a reheatable metal container that has 3 timer functions (10 min, 15 min, and 20 min) which controls a relay that turns on or off a PTC heating element. 
We hope to achieve that the product will reach a certain temperature that is needed for a safe and edible food that is reheated to a temperature of 165 fahrenheit.
